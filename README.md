# Mastermind
This program assists a player in guessing the secret code in the game, Mastermind.
At the beggining of each turn a list of possible secret codes are provided.
After the player guesses and receives the number of black (right color, right spot) and white (right color, wrong spot) pegs, this information should be inputed into the command line, and the program will again list out all the updated possible secret codes.
